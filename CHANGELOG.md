# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project doesn't care about versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Add support for multi-root workspaces, a.k.a. `.code-workspace` files (see [GH-15]).

### Changed
- Use async IO.

[GH-15]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/gnome-search-providers-vscode/pull/15

## [1.5.0] – 2021-09-25

### Added
- Add support for general Linux codium (see [GH-13]).

[GH-13]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/gnome-search-providers-vscode/pull/13

## [1.4.0] – 2021-09-08

### Added
- Add support for VSCodium (see [GH-12]).

### Changed
- The systemd service now logs directly to the systemd journal; this improves representation of log levels in logging.

[GH-12]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/gnome-search-providers-vscode/pull/12

## [1.3.0] – 2021-05-16

### Changed
- Use common code from [gnome-search-providers-jetbrains](https://github.com/lunaryorn/gnome-search-providers-jetbrains/tree/main/crates/common):
  - The search provider now moves launched processes to new `app-gnome` systemd scopes, like Gnome itself does when starting applications
  - The search provider now runs in a glib mainloop.

### Fixed
- No longer quit application instances launched by the search provider when stopping the search provider service; the search provider now moves processes to new systemd scopes to prevent this.

## [1.2.0] – 2021-04-26

### Changed

- Improve order of matches (see [GH-2]):
    - Rank matches in the workspace name higher than matches in the path, and
    - rank URL matches by position of term in match (the more to the right the better the term matched the more specific segments of the URL).

[GH-2]: https://github.com/lunaryorn/gnome-search-providers-vscode/issues/2

## [1.1.1] – 2021-04-23

### Fixed

### Fixed

- Maintain order of workspaces in results (see [GH-7]).
